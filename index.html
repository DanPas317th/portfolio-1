            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>There will be info about me.</p>
            <p>I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.
                My name is Patrick Bateman.
                I'm 27 years old.</p>

        <section class="col2" id="col">
            <h2>My abilities</h2>
            <p>There will be info about what I'm able to do.</p>
            <p>I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine.
                In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I'll put on an icepack while doing my stomach crunches.
                I can do a thousand now.
                After I remove the icepack, I use a deep-pore cleanser lotion.
                In the shower, I use a water-activated gel cleanser.
                Then a honey-almond bodyscrub.
                And on the face, an exfoliating gel-scrub.
                Then I apply an herb mint facial masque,
                which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.
                I always use an aftershave lotion with little or no alcohol,
                because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older.
                Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.</p>

            <p>There will be pinned my projects done so far.</p>
            <p>There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.
                Some kind of abstraction, but there is no real me.
                Only an entity-- something illusory.
                And though I can hide my cold gaze...
                and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours...
                and maybe you can even sense our life styles are probably comparable,
                I simply am not there.</p>
